      <p>
        It is one of Australia’s most loved attractions, with over 100 beautiful islands dotted across the reef to explore. The snorkelling and diving opportunities are some of the best in the world, with rainbow coloured corals and an array of marine life to see up close. The top five things to do on the Great Barrier Reef are Snorkeling, Scuba diving, visit Green Island, Helicopter flight, and go to White Haven Beach. Cruises are suitable for people of all ages, including families with infants and children, however it is recommended children are supervised and accompanied by a responsible adult at all times.

  <h2>Bruny Island, Tasmania</h2>
    <img src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/o86dkQkC0bY7amtyxMEdEqLSrBs=/800x600/filters:no_upscale()/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/15/5e/155e80de-1120-4659-921d-1645fb981532/southern-lights-new-zealand.jpg" alt="Bruny Island Southern Lights" class="bruny">
      <p>
        Did you know that one of the cleanest air in the world? mmhmmmm! Relatively rural, the island is free from light and city pollution (two of the biggest hindrances to seeing the Southern Lights), with the added benefit of stunning beaches and wilderness. For the best views of the Southern Lights, climb the stairs at the Neck and point your camera southwards. Southern Lights or not, the views of the island, ocean and vast, starry sky are memorable. Suitable for the whole family.

  <p>
  Kangaroo Island, third largest Australian offshore island. It’s only 150km long, yet Kangaroo Island is home to arguably the densest and most varied menagerie of wildlife in Australia. It’s landscape is so diverse you won’t believe that all this can be crammed onto one island. It was named Kangaroo Island because of its abundance of Kangaroos! It is family friendly meaning take your kids! Or don't. Just make sure your kids don't provoke the kangaroos, for some can be aggressive.
